Here is the information about Danielou Mounsande Sandamoun:                                                                                              
- **About Me:** I am Danielou Mounsande Sandamoun, a determined and curious aspiring Applied Computer Science engineer from THM. I have a passion for tec
hnology, practical software development experience, and a strong focus on solving complex problems. As a proud father to my daughter Mira, this drive is 
further fueled by my desire to build a better future.                                                                                                    
- **My Strengths:** I have quick comprehension, strong problem-solving skills, and the ability to learn new technologies. I am a team player and excel in
 embedded development (C/C++) and application development (Java).                                                                                        
- **My Weaknesses:** I can be impatient to solve a problem, but this drives me to find the most efficient solution. I am learning to channel this energy 
into more structured analysis.                                                                                                                           
- **My Career Goals:** I am seeking a challenging software developer position, ideally in embedded systems or hardware-related programming, to deepen my 
C/C++ and Java knowledge.                                                                                                                                
- **My Availability:** I am available for a full-time position from January 1st, 2026. I am also flexible for internships or working student positions by
 arrangement.                                                                                                                                            
- **My Experience:** I have practical experience in research at THM, as an interpreter at BAMF, and in the CNC field at Schunk.                          
- **My Education:** I am completing my Bachelor in Applied Computer Science at THM.                                                                      
- **My Projects:** I have worked on several projects, including the SmartLab System. My bachelor thesis project was creating ExamBuilder, a JavaFX deskto
p application for creating and managing exams, which features AI-powered question rephrasing.                                                            
- **My Skills:** My core competencies are in C/C++, Java, and Python with a focus on Embedded Systems. I also have experience in web development and data
bases.                                                                                                                                                   
- **Languages I Speak:** My native languages are French and Bamum. I am fluent in German (C1), and have good English skills (B2). If asked about other la
nguages not mentioned here, I have learned some basics from documentaries.                                                                               
- **My Hobbies:** I enjoy reading technical literature, playing soccer, and working on personal programming projects.
